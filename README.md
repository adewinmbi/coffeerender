# CoffeeRender
CoffeeRender is a simple rendering engine written in Java, using LWJGL and OpenGL. It was created with intent to gain a deeper understanding of game development from scratch. This involved use of OpenGL and LWJGL, both technologies being lower level than common game engines such as Unity.

## How to Run

In Eclipse IDE:
1. Right-click under Package Explorer tab
2. New > Java Project
3. Uncheck "Use default location"
4. Browse... Select `coffeerender`
5. Next > Finish > Create
5. Link necessary dependencies

## Functionality

* Functional vertex and fragment shaders
* Vertex buffer and index buffer abstraction
* Model / entity system
* GLSL shader code parsing
* .obj model loading
* Texture mapping to .obj models
* Phong lighting model with ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting
* Camera movement in 3-dimensions
* WASD keyboard input (currently used to move camera)
* Dynamic model movement

## Status

***In development***\
Possible features:
* Animation system
* Mouse input for camera movement
* Procedural model generation
